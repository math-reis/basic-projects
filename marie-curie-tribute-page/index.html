    <h1 id="title">Marie Curie</h1>
      <p>Marie Sk≈Çodowska Curie was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. As the first of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes, she was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris in 1906.</p>
    <p>Marie Curie is remembered for her discovery of radium and polonium, and her huge contribution to finding treatments for cancer. This work continues to inspire our charity's mission to help people and their families living with a terminal illness make the most of the time they have together by delivering expert care, emotional support and research. <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie" target="_blank">More about Marie Curie</a></p>

  <h2>Marie Curie</h2>
  
  <ul>1867. Born on 7 November 1867 in Warsaw, Poland.</ul>
  <ul>1894. Met Pierre Curie in Paris.</ul>
  <ul>1898. The Curies published strong evidence supporting the existence of the new element, which they called <strong>radium</strong>, but they still had no sample of it.</ul>
  <ul>1902. Marie eventually isolated radium (as radium chloride), determining its atomic weight as 225.93.</ul>
  <ul>1903. Marie and Pierre were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics jointly with Henri Becquerel for their combined, though separate, work on radioactivity.</ul>
  <ul>1906. Pierre was killed in a street accident after being knocked down by a horse and cart. </ul>
  <ul>1911. Her determination and remarkable endeavours led to a second Nobel Prize, this time in chemistry for creating a means of measuring radioactivity.</ul>
  <ul>1914. In October, the first machines of mobile X-ray, known as "Petits Curies", were ready, and Marie set off to be used to diagnose injuries near the battlefront.</ul>
  <ul>1921. Received the Ellan Richards Research Prize.</ul>
  <ul>1923. Received the Grand Prix du Marquis d'Argenteuil.</ul>
  <ul>1931. Received the Cameron Prize from Edinburgh University.</ul>
  <ul>1934. On 4 July, at the Sancellemoz Sanatorium in Passy, France at the age of 66, Marie Curie died. The cause of her death was given as aplastic pernicious anaemia, a condition she developed after years of exposure to radiation through her work. She left two daughters, Irene (born 1898) and Eve (born 1904). </ul>
