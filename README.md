# Basic projects

This repository contains some of my initial projects developed during the beginning of my career. The projects are organized according to the programming language that I have the most affinity with, and inside each section, they are organized according to what I consider to be the best projects. 

**Disclaimer:** most of the projects were not entirely designed by me. I had help from several online tutorials.
