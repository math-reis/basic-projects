# Basic projects

This repository contains some of my initial projects developed during the beginning of my career. The projects are organized according to the languages that I have the most affinity with, and inside each section, there are the **TOP 5** projects according to their relevance and complexity. At the end, there is a section for all remaining projects, regardless of their languages.

**Disclaimer:** most of the projects were not entirely designed by me. I had help from several online tutorials.
